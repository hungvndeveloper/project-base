Node.js Introduction
    - What is Node.js?
        - Node.js is an open source server environment
        - Node.js is free
        - Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
        - Node.js uses JavaScript on the server
    - Why Node.js?
        - Node.js uses asynchronous programming!
        - A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.
        - Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:
            - Sends the task to the computer's file system.
            - Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
            - Returns the content to the client.
            - Ready to handle the next request.
        - Here is how Node.js handles a file request:
            - Sends the task to the computer's file system.
            - Ready to handle the next request.
            - When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
        - Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
        - Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.
    - What Can Node.js Do?
        - Node.js can generate dynamic page content
        - Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
        - Node.js can collect form data
        - Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
    - What is a Node.js File?
        - Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
        - A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
        - Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
        - Node.js files have extension ".js"

Node.js Modules
    - What is a Module in Node.js?
        - Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.
        - A set of functions you want to include in your application.
    - Built-in Modules
        - Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
        - Look at our Built-in Modules Reference for a complete list of modules:
            Module	        Description
            assert	        Provides a set of assertion tests
            buffer	        To handle binary data
            child_process	To run a child process
            cluster	        To split a single Node process into multiple processes
            crypto	        To handle OpenSSL cryptographic functions
            dgram	        Provides implementation of UDP datagram sockets
            dns	            To do DNS lookups and name resolution functions
            domain	        Deprecated. To handle unhandled errors
            events	        To handle events
            fs	            To handle the file system
            http	        To make Node.js act as an HTTP server
            https	        To make Node.js act as an HTTPS server.
            net	            To create servers and clients
            os	            Provides information about the operation system
            path	        To handle file paths
            punycode	    Deprecated. A character encoding scheme
            querystring	    To handle URL query strings
            readline	    To handle readable streams one line at the time
            stream	        To handle streaming data
            string_decoder	To decode buffer objects into strings
            timers	        To execute a function after a given number of milliseconds
            tls	            To implement TLS and SSL protocols
            tty	            Provides classes used by a text terminal
            url	            To parse URL strings
            util	        To access utility functions
            v8	            To access information about V8 (the JavaScript engine)
            vm	            To compile JavaScript code in a virtual machine
            zlib	        To compress or decompress files
    - Include Modules
        - To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module:
            var http = require('http');
            -> Now your application has access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server:
            http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                res.end('Hello World!');
            }).listen(8080);
    - Create Your Own Modules
        - You can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications.
        - The following example creates a module that returns a date and time object:
            - Create a module that returns the current date and time:
                exports.myDateTime = function () {
                    return Date();
                };
            - Use the exports keyword to make properties and methods available outside the module file.
            - Save the code above in a file called "myfirstmodule.js"
    - Include Your Own Module
        - Now you can include and use the module in any of your Node.js files.
            - Example
                Use the module "myfirstmodule" in a Node.js file:
                var http = require('http');
                var dt = require('./myfirstmodule');
                http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                    res.write("The date and time are currently: " + dt.myDateTime());
                    res.end();
                }).listen(8080);
            - Notice that we use ./ to locate the module, that means that the module is located in the same folder as the Node.js file.
############################################
Node.js HTTP Module
    - The Built-in HTTP Module
        - Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
        - To include the HTTP module, use the require() method:
            var http = require('http');
    - Node.js as a Web Server
        - The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.
        - Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server:
            - Example
                var http = require('http');
                //create a server object:
                http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                    res.write('Hello World!'); //write a response to the client
                    res.end(); //end the response
                }).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080
            - The function passed into the http.createServer() method, will be executed
              when someone tries to access the computer on port 8080.
            - Save the code above in a file called "demo_http.js", and initiate the file:
                Initiate demo_http.js:
                    C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_http.js
            - If you have followed the same steps on your computer, you will see the same result as the example: http://localhost:8080
    - Add an HTTP Header:
        - If the response from the HTTP server is supposed to be displayed as HTML, you should include an HTTP header with the correct content type:
            - Example
                var http = require('http');
                http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                    res.write('Hello World!');
                    res.end();
                }).listen(8080);
            - The first argument of the res.writeHead() method is the status code, 200 means that all is OK, 
              the second argument is an object containing the response headers.
    - Read the Query String
        - The function passed into the http.createServer() has a req argument that represents the request
          from the client, as an object (http.IncomingMessage object).
        - This object has a property called "url" which holds the part of the url that comes after the domain name:
            - demo_http_url.js
                var http = require('http');
                http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                    res.write(req.url);
                    res.end();
                }).listen(8080);
    - Split the Query String
        - There are built-in modules to easily split the query string into readable parts, such as the URL module.
            - Example: Split the query string into readable parts:
                var http = require('http');
                var url = require('url');
                http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                    var q = url.parse(req.url, true).query;
                    var txt = q.year + " " + q.month;
                    res.end(txt);
                }).listen(8080);
#######################################
Node.js File System Module
    - Node.js as a File Server
        - The Node.js file system module allows you to work with the file system on your computer.
        - To include the File System module, use the require() method:
            - var fs = require('fs');
        - Common use for the File System module:
            - Read files
            - Create files
            - Update files
            - Delete files
            - Rename files
    - Read Files
        - The fs.readFile() method is used to read files on your computer.
        - Assume we have the following HTML file (located in the same folder as Node.js):
            - demofile1.html
                <html>
                <body>
                <h1>My Header</h1>
                <p>My paragraph.</p>
                </body>
                </html>
        - Create a Node.js file that reads the HTML file, and return the content:
            - ExampleGet your own Node.js Server
                var http = require('http');
                var fs = require('fs');
                http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                    fs.readFile('demofile1.html', function(err, data) {
                        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                        res.write(data);
                        return res.end();
                    });
                }).listen(8080);
    - Create Files
        - The File System module has methods for creating new files:
            - fs.appendFile()
            - fs.open()
            - fs.writeFile()
        - The fs.appendFile() method appends specified content to a file. If the file does not exist, the file will be created:
            - Example: Create a new file using the appendFile() method:
                var fs = require('fs');
                fs.appendFile('mynewfile1.txt', 'Hello content!', function (err) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log('Saved!');
                });
        - The fs.open() method takes a "flag" as the second argument, if the flag is "w" for "writing", the specified file is opened for writing. 
          If the file does not exist, an empty file is created:
            - Example: Create a new, empty file using the open() method:
                var fs = require('fs');
                fs.open('mynewfile2.txt', 'w', function (err, file) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log('Saved!');
                });
        - The fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content if it exists. If the file does not exist, a new file,
          containing the specified content, will be created:
            - Example: Create a new file using the writeFile() method:
                var fs = require('fs');
                fs.writeFile('mynewfile3.txt', 'Hello content!', function (err) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log('Saved!');
                });
    - Update Files:
        - The File System module has methods for updating files:
            - fs.appendFile()
            - fs.writeFile()
        - The fs.appendFile() method appends the specified content at the end of the specified file:
            - Example: Append "This is my text." to the end of the file "mynewfile1.txt":
                var fs = require('fs');
                fs.appendFile('mynewfile1.txt', ' This is my text.', function (err) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log('Updated!');
                });
        - The fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content:
            - Example: Replace the content of the file "mynewfile3.txt":
                var fs = require('fs');
                fs.writeFile('mynewfile3.txt', 'This is my text', function (err) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log('Replaced!');
                });
    - Delete Files:
        - To delete a file with the File System module,  use the fs.unlink() method.
        - The fs.unlink() method deletes the specified file:
            - Example: Delete "mynewfile2.txt":
                var fs = require('fs');
                fs.unlink('mynewfile2.txt', function (err) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log('File deleted!');
                });
    - Rename Files:
        - To rename a file with the File System module,  use the fs.rename() method.
        - The fs.rename() method renames the specified file:
            - Example: Rename "mynewfile1.txt" to "myrenamedfile.txt":
                var fs = require('fs');
                fs.rename('mynewfile1.txt', 'myrenamedfile.txt', function (err) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log('File Renamed!');
                });
    - Upload Files:
        - You can also use Node.js to upload files to your computer.
###################################################
Node.js URL Module
    - The Built-in URL Module
        - The URL module splits up a web address into readable parts.
        - To include the URL module, use the require() method:
            var url = require('url');
    - Parse an address with the url.parse() method, and it will return a URL object with each
      part of the address as properties:
        - Example: Split a web address into readable parts:
            var url = require('url');
            var adr = 'http://localhost:8080/default.htm?year=2017&month=february';
            var q = url.parse(adr, true);
            console.log(q.host); //returns 'localhost:8080'
            console.log(q.pathname); //returns '/default.htm'
            console.log(q.search); //returns '?year=2017&month=february'
            var qdata = q.query; //returns an object: { year: 2017, month: 'february' }
            console.log(qdata.month); //returns 'february'
    - Node.js File Server
        - Now we know how to parse the query string, and in the previous chapter we learned how to make Node.js behave as a file server. 
          Let us combine the two, and serve the file requested by the client.
        - Create two html files and save them in the same folder as your node.js files.
            - summer.html
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <body>
                <h1>Summer</h1>
                <p>I love the sun!</p>
                </body>
                </html>
            - winter.html
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <body>
                <h1>Winter</h1>
                <p>I love the snow!</p>
                </body>
                </html>
        - Create a Node.js file that opens the requested file and returns the content to the client. 
          If anything goes wrong, throw a 404 error:
            - demo_fileserver.js:
                var http = require('http');
                var url = require('url');
                var fs = require('fs');
                http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                    var q = url.parse(req.url, true);
                    var filename = "." + q.pathname;
                    fs.readFile(filename, function(err, data) {
                        if (err) {
                            res.writeHead(404, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                            return res.end("404 Not Found");
                        } 
                        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                        res.write(data);
                        return res.end();
                    });
                }).listen(8080);

Node.js NPM
    - What is NPM?
        - NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like.
        - www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use.
        - The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js
    - What is a Package?
        - A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.
        - Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project.
    - Download a Package
        - Open the command line interface and tell NPM to download the package you want.
        - NPM creates a folder named "node_modules", where the package will be placed. 
          All packages you install in the future will be placed in this folder.
    - Using a Package
        - Once the package is installed, it is ready to use.
        - Include the "upper-case" package the same way you include any other module:
            var uc = require('upper-case');
        - Create a Node.js file that will convert the output "Hello World!" into upper-case letters:
            Example: 
                var http = require('http');
                var uc = require('upper-case');
                http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});

- Node.js Events
    - Node.js is perfect for event-driven applications.
    - Events in Node.js
        - Every action on a computer is an event. Like when a connection is made or a file is opened.
        - Objects in Node.js can fire events, like the readStream object fires events when opening and closing a file:
            - Example: 
                var fs = require('fs');
                var rs = fs.createReadStream('./demofile.txt');
                rs.on('open', function () {
                    console.log('The file is open');
                });
    - Events Module:
        - Node.js has a built-in module, called "Events", where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events.
        - To include the built-in Events module use the require() method. In addition, all event properties and methods are an instance of an EventEmitter object.
          To be able to access these properties and methods, create an EventEmitter object:
            var events = require('events');
            var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
    - The EventEmitter Object:
        - You can assign event handlers to your own events with the EventEmitter object.
        - In the example below we have created a function that will be executed when a "scream" event is fired.
        - To fire an event, use the emit() method.
            var events = require('events');
            var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
            //Create an event handler:
            var myEventHandler = function () {
                console.log('I hear a scream!');
            }
            //Assign the event handler to an event:
            eventEmitter.on('scream', myEventHandler);

            //Fire the 'scream' event:
            eventEmitter.emit('scream');

Node.js Upload Files
    - The Formidable Module
        - There is a very good module for working with file uploads, called "Formidable".
        - The Formidable module can be downloaded and installed using NPM:
            C:\Users\Your Name>npm install formidable
        - After you have downloaded the Formidable module, you can include the module in any application:
            var formidable = require('formidable');
    - Upload Files
        - Now you are ready to make a web page in Node.js that lets the user upload files to your computer:
            - Step 1: Create an Upload Form
                - Create a Node.js file that writes an HTML form, with an upload field:
                - Example: 
                    This code will produce an HTML form:
                    var http = require('http');
                    http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                        res.write('<form action="fileupload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">');
                        res.write('<input type="file" name="filetoupload"><br>');
                        res.write('<input type="submit">');
                        res.write('</form>');
                        return res.end();
                    }).listen(8080);
            - Step 2: Parse the Uploaded File:
                - Include the Formidable module to be able to parse the uploaded file once it reaches the server.
                - When the file is uploaded and parsed, it gets placed on a temporary folder on your computer.
                - Example
                    The file will be uploaded, and placed on a temporary folder:
                    var http = require('http');
                    var formidable = require('formidable');
                    http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                        if (req.url == '/fileupload') {
                            var form = new formidable.IncomingForm();
                            form.parse(req, function (err, fields, files) {
                                res.write('File uploaded');
                                res.end();
                            });
                        } else {
                            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                            res.write('<form action="fileupload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">');
                            res.write('<input type="file" name="filetoupload"><br>');
                            res.write('<input type="submit">');
                            res.write('</form>');
                            return res.end();
                        }
                    }).listen(8080);
            - Step 3: Save the File
                - When a file is successfully uploaded to the server, it is placed on a temporary folder.
                - The path to this directory can be found in the "files" object, passed as the third argument in the parse() method's callback function.
                - To move the file to the folder of your choice, use the File System module, and rename the file:
                - Example
                    Include the fs module, and move the file to the current folder:
                    var http = require('http');
                    var formidable = require('formidable');
                    var fs = require('fs');
                    http.createServer(function (req, res) {
                        if (req.url == '/fileupload') {
                            var form = new formidable.IncomingForm();
                            form.parse(req, function (err, fields, files) {
                                var oldpath = files.filetoupload.filepath;
                                var newpath = 'C:/Users/Your Name/' + files.filetoupload.originalFilename;
                                fs.rename(oldpath, newpath, function (err) {
                                    if (err) throw err;
                                    res.write('File uploaded and moved!');
                                    res.end();
                                });
                            });
                        } else {
                            res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
                            res.write('<form action="fileupload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">');
                            res.write('<input type="file" name="filetoupload"><br>');
                            res.write('<input type="submit">');
                            res.write('</form>');
                            return res.end();
                        }
                    }).listen(8080);

Node.js Send an Email
    - The Nodemailer Module:
        - The Nodemailer module makes it easy to send emails from your computer.
        - The Nodemailer module can be downloaded and installed using npm:
            npm install nodemailer
        - After you have downloaded the Nodemailer module, you can include the module in any application:
            var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
    - Send an Email
        - Now you are ready to send emails from your server.
        - Use the username and password from your selected email provider to send an email. This tutorial will show you how to use your Gmail account to send an email:
            - Example:
                var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
                var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
                    service: 'gmail',
                    auth: {
                        user: 'youremail@gmail.com',
                        pass: 'yourpassword'
                    }
                });
                var mailOptions = {
                    from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
                    to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com',
                    subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',
                    text: 'That was easy!'
                };
                transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info){
                    if (error) {
                        console.log(error);
                    } else {
                        console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
                    }
                });
        - And that's it! Now your server is able to send emails.
    - Multiple Receivers:
        - To send an email to more than one receiver, add them to the "to" property of the mailOptions object, separated by commas:
            - Send email to more than one address:
                var mailOptions = {
                    from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
                    to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com, myotherfriend@yahoo.com',
                    subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',
                    text: 'That was easy!'
                }
    - Send HTML:
        - To send HTML formatted text in your email, use the "html" property instead of the "text" property:
            - Send email containing HTML:
                var mailOptions = {
                    from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
                    to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com',
                    subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',
                    html: '<h1>Welcome</h1><p>That was easy!</p>'
                }
